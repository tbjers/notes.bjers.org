While doing research for how to best install a fridge and an [[Ford Ranger/Planning aux battery installation|aux battery]] in a truck bed, I came across a YouTube video by an Australian guy that outlined how to utilize fake flooring in the bed of the truck to mount the fridge slide onto.

**In short:** that's pretty fucking smart.

So, I have ordered some marine carpet and I am currently researching materials for the fake flooring. Some suggest various types of plywood that is either marine-grade or using an aftermarket epoxy DIY seal.
