While doing research for how best to install a fridge and an [[Ford Ranger/Planning aux battery installation|aux battery]] in a truck bed, I came across a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/RN4-T50ifzg?si=fpCADBgXqZaahJkI) by an Australian guy that outlined how to utilize fake flooring in the bed of the truck to mount the fridge slide onto.

**In short:** that's pretty fucking smart.

So, I have ordered some marine carpet and I am currently researching materials for the fake flooring. Some suggest various types of plywood that is either marine-grade or using an aftermarket epoxy DIY seal.

The Aussie in the video uses 19 mm Formply, which appears to be an Australian product that is used for concrete form-work due to its high-density overlay (HDO) of phenolic resin impregnated paper that is bonded to plywood.

I think based on this information, I can safely select a marine-grade plywood as a replacement for Formply. I have no desire to try to seal plywood as I do not have a suitable workspace, like a garage.

Where do I get a sheet of good marine-grade plywood? I could try to go to local lumberyards to source this material, but I have a feeling that the money I would save at a lumberyard would not be sufficient to make for how dumb I would feel trying to talk to some lumberyard employee about acquiring said sheet.

I am not having any luck searching for marine-grade plywood on the Home Depot site. Might have to actually head out there and talk to someone. Might also hit up Lowe's to see if they have any.
